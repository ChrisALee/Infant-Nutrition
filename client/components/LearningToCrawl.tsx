        <h3>Developmental Milestones:</h3>
        <p>
            Between 8 and 10 months old, I may start crawling and even pulling
            myself up to stand. I’ll be learning some new eating skills too!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I may try to pick up small objects with my finger and thumb – a
                pincer grasp.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I will be able to move my tongue side to side, which helps me
                transfer food to my jaw for mashing and munching.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I may be getting better at holding things, like my spoon and
                cup.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I will probably want to try doing things myself. I may get mad –
                and may even stop eating – if I’m not allowed to practice.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

            <li>I’m beginning to walk and can really get around.</li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I am able to use my gums and teeth to munch through a variety of
                textures.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I’m getting better at feeding myself with my fingers and
                utensils.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I’m probably getting more demanding about feeding myself, I like
                to practice my new skills.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                I’m ready to try coarsely chopped and bite-sized pieces of
                foods. Keep pieces small for my safety and always stay near me
                during meals and snacks. I can choke easily if I eat while
                walking around.
            </li>
        </ul>

            At this stage, I may be ready to start solid foods. How will you
            know? It’s safe to start solids when I’m 6 months old and can do all
            of these things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sit up with some support.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Hold my head steady.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Close my lips around a spoon when you try feeding me.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Open mouth to show I want food.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
